        <p>>_My name is MC Dad Louigene, and I am a freelance photographer and a Model. Before I became a photographer, I was a professional welder.
          I love welding, but what I love the most is the sound my camera makes while capturing your most exceptional postures. This is just one of
          the many reasons I am passionate about photography because it's not about me, welding, or my camera, but instead about capturing your
          everlasting memory.
